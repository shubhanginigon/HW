Setup Spring Boot
- Setup the IDE say eclipse, VSCode etc. I am using eclipse as an IDE 
- Download JDK (Java Development Kit), currently using OpenJDK 11
- Generate the Demo spring boot application and open in eclipse 
- Update the DemoApplication.java with executable code to display the basic 'Hello world!' on the localhost
