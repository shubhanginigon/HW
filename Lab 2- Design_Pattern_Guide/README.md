># Design Patterns 

Design patterns are an essential part of software development. These solutions not only solve recurring problems but also help developers understand the design of a framework by recognizing common patterns.

**Prerequisites**
- Create spring boot project from the spring boot starter pack with following dependencies 
	- H2 
	- Spring web
	- JPA 
	- Lombok
- Add the other dependency such as tomcat-jasper, jasper dataformat and lombok in pom.xml from [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/)

### Following are the 6 design pattern implemented in this project
** 1. Builder**
 	- Use builder when a long list of attributes have to be maintained. In this project @builder annotation is used to generate builder function and constructor for user.

   Now to demonstrate, create BuilderController.java with function getUser() and use User.builder() which is created automatically by lombok
   
![alt](./img/builderController.PNG)

   Test from postman if the user is created when

** 2. Factory** 
	- When creation logic is complex and difficult to maintain then, create a interface that will handles all the creation in one place, and let the client calls that interface. That's Factory pattern. Here factory pattern is used for different roles of users. 
	
![alt](./img/role.PNG)
	
   create some concrete role Admin.java and Member.java

![alt](./img/admin.PNG)

![alt](./img/member.PNG)

   Now create roleFactory.java and controller for the same
 
![alt](./img/roleFactory.PNG)

![alt](./img/FactoryController.PNG)

   Test the factory pattern implementation using postman

** 3. Adapter**
	- Adapter allows two unrelated/uncommon interfaces to work together, without changing their existing code.
Then use a single class (the adapter class) to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces/classes.
	Inside package adapter, create the two interfaces, LineFormattable.java and CsvFormattable.java

![alt](./img/linef.PNG)

 ![alt](./img/csvf.PNG)

   Then create two concrete classes NewLineFormatter.java and CsvFormatter.java that implements the interfaces

![alt](./img/newlinef.PNG) 

![alt](./img/csvfm.PNG)

   Create CsvAdapterImpl.java with the following code

![alt](./img/adapterimp.PNG)

   To demonstrate, under your Main program, try this following code
   
![alt](./img/adapterMain.PNG)

![alt](./img/adapterTest.PNG) 

** 4. Proxy**
	- Proxy is that surrogate object can implement additional logic without complicating the real object, for example, here, letâ€™s implement some access logic into our CommandAccess object and create the concrete class CommandAccessImpl.java
	
![alt](./img/commandaccess.PNG)

![alt](./img/commandaccessimp.PNG)

   Now, create the proxy CommandAccessProxy.java, which we have added some access logic

![alt](./img/commandaccessproxy.PNG)
   
   the proxy on our Main program ProxyMain.java
   
![alt](./img/proxymain.PNG)   

** 5. Decorator** 
	- Decorator can be useful for adding features without over using inheritance. First, create an abstract class of Character.java inside decorator model 

![alt](./img/charac.PNG)

   now create Swordman.java extending the Character class

![alt](./img/swordman.PNG)

   create an  abstract class for CharacterDecorator.java
   
![alt](./img/chardecorator.PNG) 

   Now create Weapon.java for CharacterDecorator, to use as a decorator for swordman
 
![alt](./img/weapon.PNG)  

   To test this write the code in main class as follows, and check the console for output 

![alt](./img/decoratormain.PNG) 

![alt](./img/decoratorTest.PNG) 


** 6. State**
	- State pattern is useful when maintaining an entity contains multiple transitions between states
 First, create an interface State.java to impose the rule
 
![alt](./img/state.PNG)

create concrete class Swordman.java that implement this interface.

  ![alt](./img/swordmanstate.PNG)
 
 run the main program Main.java to demonstrate state changes

![alt](./img/statemain.PNG)
